## Introduction
With rapid advancements in the digital age, chronic diseases have been significantly decresed with the advancement in healthcare technology. Yet, diabetes has emerged as the new unseen pandamic. This is because of many people having a sendatary lifestylye due to multiple factors such as the lack of time, motivation or simply the lack of sports and leisure facilities. According to the IDF, 537 million adults (20-79 years) are living with diabetes - 1 in 10. This number is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. 

With the alarming increase in the rate of patients with diabetes, it is very important for the early detection of diabetes. This is because with early diagnosis proper treatment can be assesed in order to avoid further complications of the disease. Numerous studies have been conducted on disease prediction, including diagnosis, prediction, categorization, and treatment.

This project delves into the realm of predictive modeling for diabetes, employing techniques from both machine learning and data analysis. Our aim is to develop a robust model capable of identifying individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, using certain attributes, for effective prevention and management strategies.
